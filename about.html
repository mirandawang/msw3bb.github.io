                                    Giv2giv is a social venture designed to solve a critical problem: currently in the U.S. large charities absorb the

majority of donated funds and are able to put them in an endowment for investment, allowing idle funds to “grow”;

however, smaller charities cannot do this and they are forced to put more energy into seeking for funds constantly.

Giv2giv.org aims to make it possible for every person, every organization, regardless of their net worth, to be able to

have a “mini endowment” that grows overtime and eventually become self­sustainable. </li></div>

Enactus is about action. It’s all about what you do.

Each of our projects are different. Maybe you will learn how to market a business, or maybe you’ll teach refugees job skills. Maybe you’ll start something new and lead a team of your own.

No matter what project you join, you’ll learn how to work with a team to make a real impact in our world.
