                                <b><h3>Giv2Giv</h3></b>
							<p>Giv2giv.org is a registered nonprofit online donation platform that enables donors to build up their portfolios of small local charities. This platform invests a portion of the donations it receives first into a balanced fund called Pax World Balanced Fund and then distribute the principals and returns together to the charities as designated by the donors. In this way Giv2giv.org is able to create sustainable impact for small local charities to better fulfill their missions with less concern about raising fundings. 
							</p><p>
	Giv2giv.org does not have any revenue through transactions or advertisements and is largely relying on grants for its marketing efforts to expand the user base. Therefore, it is important that it maximizes the efficiency of its online marketing campaigns. Currently the website seems to have a low percentage of returning users or viewers who are willing to navigate through the website. Besides connecting with the CEO and see if he needs any other assistance such as continuing LinkedIn campaigns, the project team will focus on the problem of how to better retain new website users and to encourage exploration on the website. This new way of philanthropy could be revolutionizing, yet it needs to be friendly enough to be accepted by donors.

It approaches include both to diminish the source of food waste and to increase the utility of the food ordered by events and individuals. In the past the project has partnered with Kuma restaurant to help with its supply chain and food disposition to food bank. It has also tested promising initiatives such as dorm food exchange shelves for students to exchange excessive food .The project team this year will further these efforts and also explore potential new initiatives to increase the utility of food on Ground. One of the major issues is to convince businesses to work with us and to motivate people to participate in the excessive food exchange initiatives in certain forms.</p></div>
